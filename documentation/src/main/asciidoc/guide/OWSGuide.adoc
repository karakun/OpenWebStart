== Introduction

Java Web Start (JWS) was deprecated in Java 9, and starting with Java 11, Oracle removed JWS from their JDK distributions. This means that clients that have the latest version of Java installed can no longer use JWS-based applications. And since public support of Java 8 has ended in Q2/2019, companies no longer get any updates and security fixes for Java Web Start.

This is why some enthusiasts at Karakun decided to create OpenWebStart, an open source reimplementation of the Java Web Start technology. This guide describes how you can use OpenWebStart as a replacement for JWS and continue using your JNLP-based applications  with little or no change at all.

We appreciate your feedback. If you feel that there's a lack of documentation in a certain area or if you find inaccuracies in the documentation, please don't hesitate to contact us at openwebstart@karakun.com or the  https://board.karakun.com/viewforum.php?f=4[support forum].

=== What is OpenWebStart?

OpenWebStart is an open source reimplementation of the Java Web Start technology, released under the GPL with Classpath Exception. It provides the most commonly used features of Java Web Start and the JNLP standard, so that your customers can continue using applications based on Java Web Start and JNLP without any change. OpenWebStart is based on Iced-Tea-Web and follows the JNLP-specification defined in JSR-56.

The main focus of OpenWebStart is the execution of JNLP-based applications. Additionally, the tool contains various modules that simplify your Web Start workflows and let you configure OpenWebStart to suit your needs:

App Manager:: manages the versions of any JNLP-based application that is executed by OpenWebStart.

JVM Manager:: manages Java versions and Java updates on the client.

Control Panel:: provides a graphical user interface to configure OpenWebStart.

Updater:: downloads and installs new versions of OpenWebStart.

== Installation
OpenWebStart can be installed on Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems and there are two different ways to install OpenWebStart:

* Using the *interactive installation* with auto-update functionality
* Using the *unattended installation* for automated roll-outs

If you use Web Start for several small customers or on your own, we recommend using the interactive installer. Our native installer will set up everything on your Windows, Mac, or Linux system so that OpenWebStart is immediately ready to use.
OpenWebStart checks for updates automatically, and the Updater component keeps the tool current without the need for any user interaction.

If you or your customers are companies with IT departments of their own, we recommend an unattended installation to roll out OpenWebStart on multiple client machines.
Instead of walking through the graphical installer of OWS on every machine your IT department can pre-define the responses for the installation options in a response varfile.

=== Interactive Installation

==== Windows

1. Please wait for OpenWebStart to be installed on your computer.
1. Click Finish on the completion screen to close the wizard.

If you need help installing OpenWebStart, also have a look at the public installation and configuration discussions at the https://board.karakun.com/viewforum.php?f=10[Support Forum].

=== Unattended Installation
If you or your customers are companies with IT departments of their own, we recommend an unattended installation to roll out OpenWebStart on multiple client machines. In this scenario, the auto-update functionality is inactive; your IT department is free to plan and handle rollouts of new versions based on your internal workflows.

When installing OpenWebStart, several properties can be predefined in a so-called `response.varfile` file.

Some of the supported properties are lockable. If a property is lockable, you can define an additional property of type `PROPERTY_NAME.locked=true` to prevent users from editing the property in the user interface. For example, to define a value for the `ows.jvm.manager.server.default` property that cannot be changed in the user interface, specify the following two properties:

----
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https://my.custom.server
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

Have a look at the <<Configuration Properties Overview>> to get an overview of all properties that can be specified in the `response.varfile`.

To create a `response.varfile` file, run the installation of OpenWebStart at least once manually. By doing so a `response.varfile` file is created in OpenWebStart installation folder in your system. In the installation folder, you find a `.install4j` folder that contains the basic `response.varfile` file. The content of such a file looks like this:

----
sys.adminRights$Boolean=false
sys.fileAssociation.extensions$StringArray="jnlp","jnlpx"
sys.fileAssociation.launchers$StringArray="313","313"
sys.installationDir=/Applications/OpenWebStart
sys.languageId=de
----

You can easily edit this file and add additional properties based on the table in this article. Do not change the initial content of the file, and add new properties always to the end of the file. After editing, a `response.varfile` file might look like this:

----
sys.adminRights$Boolean=false
sys.fileAssociation.extensions$StringArray="jnlp","jnlpx"
sys.fileAssociation.launchers$StringArray="313","313"
sys.installationDir=/Applications/OpenWebStart
sys.languageId=de
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https://my.custom.server
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

If you now use such a file to install OpenWebStart, all the properties will be automatically imported and used at the first start of OpenWebStart.

=== JNLP File Association

To ensure that your computer handles links, desktop shortcuts, or start menu entries to JNLP applications correctly, you should associate the JNLP file type (`*.jnlp`) on your computer with OpenWebStart.
In case you used a Oracle JVM in the past, your JNLP file association might still be set to Oracle javaws.

Note that during the installation process, OpenWebStart will not change file associations of any existing Oracle javaws executable, so you can use both.

To associate .JNLP applications in Windows Explorer

1. Right-click the JNLP app and select *Open With > Choose Another App*
1. Click *More Apps* and scroll down
1. Click *Look for Another App on this PC*
1. Browse to OpenWebStart at +
   `C:\Program Files\OpenWebStart\javaws`
1. Click *Open* to associate this JNLP file with OpenWebStart

To associate .JNLP applications in macOS Finder:

1. Right-click the JNLP app and select *Open With > Other...*
1. Browse to OpenWebStart at `/Applications/Open Web Start/javaws`
1. Click *Open* to associate this JNLP file with OpenWebStart

=== How to Uninstall

In case you need to uninstall OpenWebStart follow the steps below:

For Windows and macOS::

1. Go to your OpenWebStart directory
1. Run the Uninstaller
1. Click *Next* in the OpenWebstart Uninstaller Wizard
1. Wait for the Uninstaller to complete
1. Click *Finish* on the completion screen to close the wizard.

For Linux:: Use your package manager and remove the package OpenWebStart

== Updates

OpenWebStart can be configured to automatically check for new releases and perform automatic updates.

To do so go to the "Updates" Panel in the OWS Settings.
It is possible to define an update strategy on every `start`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `never`.

== Configuration

The standard way to configure OpenWebStart is to use the OWS Settings application.
The executable is located in the installation directory and is named `itw-settings`.

All settings managed by this application are stored on the file system in a file called `deployment.properties`.
For Windows the file is located at `${USER_HOME}\.config\icedtea-web\deployment.properties`.
For Mac and Linux the file is located at `${USER_HOME}/.config/icedtea-web/deployment.properties`.

This file can be edited with a regular text editor.
For some expert configurations this may be necessary, but for most cases the graphical UI will be sufficient.

Besides a per-user configuration by manipulating `deployment.properties`, there exists also the possibility to define a system-wide configuration.
This allows setting up a common configuration for multiple users on a single computer or helps in managing a corporate infrastructure where many computers need to be configured identically.For more details see <<System Configuration>>.

Various life-cycle aspects of your JNLP applications can be configured, such as download and update strategy or caching behavior.You can configure the JVM vendor and version that should be used to launch your JNLP application as well as proxy settings, security settings, certificates and server whitelists.

The following chapters will describe these various configuration possibilities in detail.

=== JVM Management

#<TODO: describe OWS settings options>#

==== JVM Download Server

OpenWebStart can fetch JVMs and JVM updates from a download server that is specified in the JVM Manager Configuration of the OWS Settings application.
The default points to `https://download-openwebstart.com/jvms.json`.

==== Setup a Custom Download Server
If you want to set up your own JVM download server you must provide a json file which lists all available JVMs.

This json file must contain the following data:

[source]
----
{
    "cacheTimeInMillis":<miliseconds>,
    "runtimes":[
        {
            "version":<JVM version>,
            "vendor":<vendor name>,
            "os":<OS identifier>,
            "href":<absolute url to the archive containing the JVM>
        },

        ... more runtime definitions
}

----

cacheTimeInMillis:: The time which needs to elapse before a client is allowed to contact the server again.Usually the server is accessed once per application startup.

os:: Possible values are: MAC64, MAC32, LINUX64, LINUX32, WIN64, WIN32

=== Proxy Settings

#<TODO: describe OWS settings options>#

=== Security Settings

#<TODO: describe OWS settings options>#

=== Certificates

#<TODO: describe OWS settings options>#

=== Server Whitelists

The "Server Whitelists" panel in OWS settings displays the server whitelist.
To define a server whitelist you have to edit the `deployment.properties` file in your config directory with a text editor by adding a new line similar to the following:

[source]
----
deployment.security.whitelist=10.10.10.10, google.com, some.server.net
----

The different servers are listed as a comma separated string.
Localhost is implicitly always in the white list.
If you delete the line again then no whitelisting is applied and all servers are reachable.

Note that whitelisting only applies while downloading resources (jars and jnlps) and not while an application is running.
Thus an application can open a connection to a server which is not in the white list.

It is also possible to specify the content of the whitelist in the response file of an unattended OWS installation.

#<TODO: describe the wildcards supported for whitelist entries introduced with OWS 1.2.0>#

=== Logging

OpenWebStart provides access to log message information to monitor application execution and analyse erroneous behavior by the Log Console GUI and log files. Both can be enabled in the "Logging" panel in OWS settings.

.Logging options in OWS Settings
image::OWS_Logging.png[width="80%", align="center"]

==== Log Console
OpenWebStart provides the possiblity to show a log console window where all log messages of OpenWebStart iteself and the launched JNLP application are displayed.

Various filter options can be selected to reduce the log output. To show the log console choose "Show" in "Log Console" selection.

==== Logging to Files
Logging to files can be activated for file-based log analysis or to send the logs files to the OpenWebStart support.

You have to select "Activate debug logging", "Log to file", and specify the log folder where OpenWebStart should write the log files.

By default this is `<user_home>/.config/icedtea-web/log`. Ensure that your folder has write access permissions when customize this path.

#<TODO: describe the log file names used for OWS logs, JNLP application logs introduced with OWS 1.2.0>#

=== Remote Debugging

#<TODO: describe OWS settings options>#

=== System Configuration

When loading the configuration during the start of OpenWebStart the following steps are executed:

1. Load the default values which are hardcoded in the source code.
1. Search for a system configuration.
1. Load the system configuration if one was found.
1. Load the user configuration.

Whenever a configuration is loaded the values which are already defined are updated.
There is however the possibility to lock a property.
If a property is locked then subsequent configurations may not modify the value.
This allows enforcing certain values on a system level.
Any changes the user makes in his personal configuration file will not have any effect on the locked property.

==== Defining the System Configuration

The system configuration needs to be defined in the following way.

*Windows:* create the file `%windir%\Sun\Java\deployment\deployment.config` and add the following properties:

*MacOs and Linux:* create the file `/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config` and add the following properties:

deployment.system.config:: The URL to the system configuration.
The name of the file can be freely chosen.
Special characters need escaping.
See the following examples:
* `deployment.system.config=file\:/C\:/Window/Sun/Java/global.properties`
* `deployment.system.config=file\:/etc/.java/deployment/base.properties`
* `deployment.system.config=https\:192.168.1.1./javaws/system.properties`

deployment.system.config.mandatory:: If set to `true` then OpenWebStart will fail if it is unable to load the system settings
This property is optional.
The default value is `false`.

The final file should look something like this:

[source]
----
deployment.system.config=https\:192.168.1.1./javaws/system.properties
deployment.system.config.mandatory=true
----

==== Content of the System Configuration

The simplest way to create a system configuration is to start the `itw-settings`.
After saving the configuration the modified properties are written to the user configuration file.
For Windows the file is located at `${USER_HOME}\.config\icedtea-web\deployment.properties`.
For Mac and Linux the file is located at `${USER_HOME}/.config/icedtea-web/deployment.properties`.

The customized user configuration can be used as a starting point for the system configuration.
Simply copy the file and remove the properties which should not be defined on the system level.

OpenWebStart does not save properties which have the default value.
Therefore the generated user configuration may not contain all the values you wish to enforce on the system level.

Please contact openwebstart@karakun.com if you need to know the key and valid values for a specific configuration.

==== Locking a Property

One of the use cases is to enforce some configurations to all users in your corporate environment.
This can be achieved by locking configuration on a system level.
To lock a property you need to define a second entry with a `.locked` postfix.

Here an example:

[source]
----
ows.jvm.manager.server.default=https\://192.168.1.1/jvms.json
ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked=true
----

TIP: the value of `ows.jvm.manager.server.default.locked` is ignored.
The presence of the key is sufficient for locking the property.

=== Configuration Properties Overview

The following table provides an overview of the configuration properties of OpenWebStart.

NOTE: The properties marked in the column LK are lockable.The properties marked in the column RV can be specified in the response.varfile.See <<Configuration>> and <<Unattended Installation>> for further details.
